# Dice-rolling-simulator-with-python
This program starts by printing a welcome message and entering a loop that prompts the user to roll the dice. If the user types "quit", the loop breaks and the program ends. Otherwise, the program generates a random number between 1 and 6 and prints the result to the console.
